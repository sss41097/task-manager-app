Developed a task management web app using Node.js and MongoDB. 
The application allows user login implemented via JWT authentication and Express middleware.
Multiple user accounts and their tasks can be stored. 
Implemented Pagination, Sorting and Filtering to retreive tasks created. 
The application also supports file uploads for users to upload documents and pictures.
Implemented notification emails and welcoming emails to be sent to users using SendGrid.
Deployed the task manager API to heroku.
Finished setting up the Jest Testing Framework to create an automated test suite for the application.
